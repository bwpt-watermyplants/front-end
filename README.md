Workflow:
You can look at the issues and project tab where we can put what we're working on. It's not required, just a cool place to keep track of out work

Create a branch with a name describing what you are working on and create a pull request.
Examples of branch names:
- bugfix/user-login
- chore/fixing-typos
- feature/creating-login
- enhancement/styling-login
