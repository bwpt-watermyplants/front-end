`git pull origin main` EACH TIME BEFORE YOU START CODING

WHEN U INSTALL STUFF USE YARN,
Instead of doing `npm install xyz`, do `yarn add xyz`

Workflow:
You can look at the issues and project tab where we can put what we're working on. It's not required, just a cool place to keep track of out work

We'll be working off of main to preven't conflict errors. The feature branch system works but it can bring complications and 
waste much time.
