`git pull origin main` or sister branch you are working on  EACH TIME BEFORE YOU START CODING

WHEN U INSTALL STUFF USE YARN,
`npm install` === `yarn`
`npm uninstall` === `yarn remove`
Instead of doing `npm install xyz`, do `yarn add xyz`

Workflow:
You can look at the issues and project tab where we can put what we're working on. It's not required, just a cool place to keep track of out work

Create a branch with a name describing what you are working on and create a pull request. Examples of branch names:

bugfix/user-login
chore/fixing-typos
feature/creating-login
enhancement/styling-login

In your pull request, to make it easier for others to read it 
you can name it like

Chore/feature/ehhancement/etc: Title of pull request
