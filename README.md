## Before You Code

- [] `git pull origin main` or sister branch you are working on EACH TIME BEFORE YOU START CODING
- [] You can look at the issues and project tab where we can put what we're working on. It's not required, just a cool place to keep track of out work

## WHEN U INSTALL STUFF USE YARN,

- [] `npm install` === `yarn`
- [] `npm uninstall` === `yarn remove`
- [] `npm install xyz` = `yarn add xyz`

## Structure

- [] Components will be in the component folder
- [] Views folder will be components that are an entire page
- [] Reducers folder hold the state of the app
- [] Actions folder holds the operational functions of the app

## Workflow

Create a branch with a name describing what you are working on and create a pull request. Examples of branch names:

- [] bugfix/user-login
- [] chore/fixing-typos
- [] feature/creating-login
- [] enhancement/styling-login

For very small changes you do not need too make a pull request
Trevor will be your reviewer
